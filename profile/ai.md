# AI
Work in progress :)

AI has been a very hot topic recently but AI has been around for a LONG time. AI has done great things which greatly benifit society such as detecting cancer from scans. But the AI that is being talked about recently is Generative AI. Things like large language models, image generators, music generators and many more. AI companies are taking large amounts of content people have created and using them to train their models. While I won't talk on whether or not this is legal, I don't think this is ethical. People are creating content to share with others wheather its drawings, information or even just conversations this is all being picked up to train AIs that people are making money from. Not to mention that this emense scraping of the internet is actualy costing the people who make or publish this content money. For instance Wikimedia has seen a massive increase in expensive traffic which is attributed to bots collecting content for AI. I don't think this is a ethical model for AI and I myself have chosen not to support it. But where they get their training data from isn't the only issue I have with AI.
